# Project Restructuring Summary

This document outlines the changes made to the Ollama Playlist Generator project to move from a single-file design to a more structured Flask application.

## Changes Made

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - Created a proper Flask application structure with `app`, `static`, and `templates` directories
   - Organized static assets into `css`, `js`, and `images` subdirectories
   - Separated templates into individual files (`layout.html`, `index.html`, `history.html`, `settings.html`)

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Moved application initialization to `app/__init__.py`
   - Moved routes and business logic to `app/routes.py`
   - Created a main entry point in `run.py`

3. **User Interface**:
   - Implemented a modern dark theme with sidebar navigation
   - Added support for viewing and rating playlist history
   - Improved form layout and user experience
   - Added real-time streaming output for playlist generation
   - Added playlist sharing functionality

4. **Configuration**:
   - Created `config.ini.example` as a template for user configuration
   - Added support for both Navidrome and Plex integration
   - Added platform toggle options

## Getting Started

1. Create your configuration file:
   ```
   cp config.ini.example config.ini
   ```

2. Edit `config.ini` with your Ollama, Navidrome, and/or Plex settings

3. Run the application:
   ```
   ./start_app.sh
   ```
   
   Or manually:
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

4. Access the web interface at: http://localhost:5001

## Verification

Run the setup check script to verify your installation:
```
python check_setup.py
```

This will check for required dependencies, file structure, and configuration.

## Next Steps

Some potential improvements for the future:

1. Add support for additional music platforms
2. Create a more sophisticated recommendation algorithm
3. Add visualization of music preferences and history
